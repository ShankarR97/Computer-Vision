# Computer-Vision

# What is Computer Vision?
Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.

# How Computer Vision Works?
Computer vision needs lots of data. It runs analyses of data over and over until it discerns distinctions and ultimately recognize images. For example, to train a computer to recognize automobile tires, it needs to be fed vast quantities of tire images and tire-related items to learn the differences and recognize a tire, especially one with no defects.

# Computer Vision History
Scientists and engineers have been trying to develop ways for machines to see and understand visual data for about 60 years. Experimentation began in 1959 when neurophysiologists showed a cat an array of images, attempting to correlate a response in its brain.
# 1974 -  The introduction of optical character recognition (OCR) technology, which could recognize text printed in any font or typeface.
# 1982, neuroscientist David Marr established that vision works hierarchically and introduced algorithms for machines to detect edges, corners, curves and similar basic shapes. 
# 2000, the focus of study was on object recognition, and by 2001, the first real-time face recognition applications appeared. Standardization of how visual data sets are tagged and annotated emerged through the 2000s. 
# 2010, the ImageNet data set became available. It contained millions of tagged images across a thousand object classes and provides a foundation for CNNs and deep learning models used today.
# 2012, a team from the University of Toronto entered a CNN into an image recognition contest. The model, called AlexNet, significantly reduced the error rate for image recognition.

# Top 5 Computer Vision Applications

# Self-driving cars:
            Computer vision helps self-driving cars understand their surroundings and thereby drive the passengers safely to their destination, avoiding potential collisions and accidents.
# Facial recognition:
            Computer vision algorithms identify facial features in images and correlate them with the database of face profiles.
# Medical diagnosis: 
            Engineers at the University of Central Florida’s Computer Vision Research Center taught a computer to find specks of lung cancer in CT scans, which is often difficult.
# Manufacturing:
            Computer vision helps enhance production lines and digitize processes and workers in the manufacturing industry.
# Law:
            Computer vision enables the prevention of crimes by helping security officials scan live footage from a public place to detect objects such as guns or identify suspect behavioral patterns
